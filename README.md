We can use Object Detection algorithm to detect the license plate from an image or video and then we can perform OCR or Optical Character Recognition on the cropped license plates. By splitting the problem into two components, we have made it easier and efficient to perform License Plate Recognition (LPR). Hence, the problem can be divided into two sub-problems as we mentioned above: 1. Number Plate Detection. This problem can be tackled using Object Detection approach where we need to train our model using the car/other vehicle images with number plates. 2. Extracting text from the detected Number Plate. This problem can be solved using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) which can be helpful in extracting alphanumeric characters from cropped Number Plate images.
